def detect_damage_analytically(audio_data: ndarray, audio_sample_rate: int) -> ndarray:
    '''Using analytical means, detects occurances of damage in the sample.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    audio_data: ndarray
        The raw amplitude data for the audio sample
    audio_sample_rate: int
        The sample rate with which the audio data was recorded

    Return
    ------
    dmg_detections: ndarray
        Each value in this array represents the damage status of a sample
        of the input audio data. Values may be either 1 or 0 representing the 
        presence (or lack thereof) of damage in the sample.
    '''
    pass


def detect_damage_with_AI(audio_data: ndarray, audio_sample_rate: int) -> ndarray:
    '''Using machine learning, detects occurances of damage in the sample.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    audio_data: ndarray
        The raw amplitude data for the audio sample
    audio_sample_rate: int
        The sample rate with which the audio data was recorded

    Return
    ------
    dmg_detections: ndarray
        Each value in this array represents the damage status of a 'frame_width' sized
        chunk of the input audio data. Values may be either 1 or 0 representing the 
        presence (or lack thereof) of damage in the sample.
    '''
    pass


def score_damage(dmg_detections: ndarray, trigger_detections: ndarray) -> ndarray:
    '''Analyzes damage detections alongside trigger detections to rate and score the
    occurances of damage in the sample.

    Both arrays must be the same size.

    Damage is classified as follows:

    Class 0: No damage detected AND trigger is in 'off' state
    Class 1: Trigger is in 'on' state AND no damage is detected 
    Class 2: Damage is detected while the trigger is 'on' but ceases once the
    trigger returns to the 'off' state
    Class 3: Damage is detected while the trigger is 'on' and persists for 5
    seconds or less beyond the point when trigger transitions to 'off'
    Class 4: Damage is detected while the trigger is 'on' and persists for 
    longer than 5 seconds beyond the point when trigger transitions to 'off'
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    dmg_detections: ndarray
        An array representing damage occurances on a per-frame basis. A 1 indicates damage
        found to be present within that frame, a 0 indicates the opposite.
    trigger_detections: ndarray
        An array representing detections of a trigger signal on a per-frame basis. 1 indicates
        signal-active, 0 indicates signal-inactive

    Return
    ------
    damage_score: ndarray
        An array which contains the damage rating/score for each frame in the input sample. Values
        in this array may be 0-4 indicating the class of damage present in each sample.
